Expense Reimbursement System

Project Description:

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can log in and submit requests for reimbursements and view their past tickets and pending requests. Managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursements.

Technologies Used:

JavaScript vECMAScript 2020

HTML v5

CSS v3

PostgreSQL v10.17

Python v3.9.5

Flask v2.0.1

Postman v8

AWS RDS

Features:

Employees can view their past and pending reimbursements as well as post new ones

Managers can view all past and pending reimbursements as well as approve or deny them

To do:

Allow table filtering and sorting for reimbursement tables

Allow managers to approve/deny more than one reimbursement at a time

Getting Started:

git clone 27c27072e4ba4b978b86e4e29c55234bc8aa2d2d

git commit

git pull

Usage:

Log in using a valid pre-determined employee or manager email and password

Employees and managers can see reimbursements on the table in the top-center portion of the screen

Employees can fill enter a reimbursement amount and reason, then press the submit button to finalize.

Managers can click on a reimbursement and set a new approval using the buttons below. The confirm changes button will finalize the reimbursement's approval. NOTE: Only one reimbursement can properly be finalized at a time. Issues will arise if more than one reimbursement's approval is finalized at once.
